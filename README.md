In this sketch, two Braitenberg vehicles traverse a canvas. The green (or teal) vehicle explores non-aggressively, embodying curiosity and a quest for the unknown. Simultaneously, the brown vehicle pursues the green one, symbolizing the perpetual chase to capture elusive ideas. Their paths intertwine, crafting an abstract picture that metaphorically represents the intricate process of expressing thoughts through words, images, and sculptural elements.
